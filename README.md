# ormlette

Ormlette is a delightful ORM (?) for Gleam. It's features include but are not limited to:

- A (pretty awesome) schema DSL
- A powerful query DSL that can be exported to `gleam-cake` Select statements, and used directly with `cake`
- A CLI to automatically generate easy-use types

> Ormlette is currently in the very early stages of development, so advice/feature requests/bug reports are super helpful!
